# Hack-a-thoughts: [The Idea I Chose to Explore]

## Context
For this hackathon, the team and I decided to explore what is currently available in our data but blocked by unwieldy, expensive, and inefficient queries? How could we rethink the data we already have? Without the constraints of our current stack and data structure, what could we come up with?

## What Was It? 

I wanted to take this time to think about how our product would change if we changed the "atomic unit" of our data. That is, what would change if we went from aggregating at the [data point A] level to aggregating at the [data point B] level? What would new insights would we surface? By focusing on a different data point, what would we lose? By "atomic unit", I mean what is the main data point that we are currently aggregating on and surfacing information on? 

For example, if music company first started aggregating on number of instruments sold, the atomic unit would be the instruments. But what if that music store instead started measuring and running analyses on what employees could do to keep people in the store for longer, therefore making the "atomic unit" the customers they serve.

## What Did I Explore?

I wanted to know what new visualizations we could create if we sliced our data an entirely different way? Instead of focusing on [current aggregation unit], what would we gain from focusing on [new aggregation unit] instead? What other valuable insights could we unlock from looking at our data from a different angle?

* [new question from the perspective of new data]
* [another new question from the perspective of new data]
* How would we redesign our UI to support this new data?

## What Did I Come Up With?
I came up with a couple of ideas based on some work that @awesome_developer3 and their team did a while ago that, at the time, was not feasible due to our constraints. But given that those constraints are not in play for this hackathon, I decided to see where that could go.

From @awesome_developer3's work, a few ideas came to mind, and one of them felt like a pretty solid idea to at least get the design/user flow on paper.

This is a reimagining of our dashboard with [new metric] as our atomic unit, and some new insights that we gain from focusing on [new metric] instead of [old metric].

In the end, I came up with [X ideas] to explore from a design perspective.

### Pros and Benefits: [Idea 1]
Here are my thoughts for why [Idea 1] could benefit us:

* [perceived customer benefit]
* [perceived developer benefit]
* [evidence of customer desire]
* [technical analysis on why Idea 1 is a good improvement]

### Cons and Risks: [Idea 1]
Every project comes with risks, and here are the risks that I anticipate if we go down this route

* [complexity risk]
* [time constraint risk]
* [customer indifference risk]
* [analysis on how it would/would not fit in our current product]

[rinse and repeat for every idea]

## Conclusion
As exciting as [new idea] sounds, and as interesting of a problem it solves, it will not come without risks. This hackathon was a blue-sky exercise where there were no constraints, and, while possible, this would be a long-term effort from a team of people.
