# My Writing

Hello! Thank you for coming to my writing repo, where I keep interesting templates for some of my technical writing. These can serve as writing samples, or as references for my voice when delivering news in a professional setting. I hope you'll find some of these templates interesting!

## My Reference Books

* [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) is a wonderful first step into design fundamentals that served as my introduction to UX Design principles. My main takeaway from it was to systematize as many aspects of your design as possible (colors, font sizes, spacings, etc) by using standardized base values and scaling them up or down as needed.

* [Full Stack D3 and Data Visualization](https://fullstack.gumroad.com/l/fullstack-d3-advanced) is probably the most comprehensive resource for data visualization out there. D3 as a library can be pretty daunting without having some guidance on how to use the extremely powerful tools that it has to offer. Amelia Wattenberger breaks down these complex concepts into manageable chapters and provides code examples in vanilla JavaScript that are easily transcribeable to your framework of choice.
