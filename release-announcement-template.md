# Announcing a New Feature!

## What?? 
Hot off the presses, [the name of your new feature] will be in production and in the hands of customers this week! @awesome_developer1, @awesome_developer2, @amazing_product_manager, and I are proud to announce the release of [New Feature]!

Here's a rundown of what it does, where you can find it, and how it works:

[explanation of feature]


## Why??
Find customer-sourced feature requests that demonstrate the need.

* [Example Company A] has stated that they have been looking for [the name of your new feature] for a long time now, and now we are here to delight them.

* [Example Company B] has given feedback over the course of their contract life that they would love if [current feature] also had [new capability], and we are here to serve that ask.

* [Example Company C] has made us aware that they will churn without additional support in [this product area] because it is unwieldy and non-intuitive. We've made improvements to it to hopefully save them from churning

Given all of this information, @awesome_developer1, @awesome_developer2, @amazing_product_manager, and I felt that it was a good use of our time to serve this need, as the customer impact of this feature, combined with the feasibility of getting it done in a timely manner made it worthwile to do.

## How??
[New Feature] was not a solo effort. @awesome_developer1, @awesome_developer2, and I worked really well together for months on this, iterating over and over on how to create the best possible UI.

@awesome_developer, @awesome_developer2, and I split the greater problem evenly into an equal number of smaller tasks, spanning from UI design, to API endpoint, to discussing the "handshake JSON" that would serve as the placeholder as we gathered real data, to implementing UI spec. 

With the help of @amazing_product_manager, we were able to source valuable feedback from our beta cohort of customers to inform our development path and iterate quickly on what they were telling us. @amazing_product_manager was critical in helping us test our assumptions on real people, especially in the prototyping stage where much of our design was still fluid and able to be changed.

## Design??
@awesome_developer1 and I led the design charge on this, with @awesome_developer1 being the final authority, as I deferred more to their experience in UX while I provided support. We spent some weeks synchronously discussing every aspect of this feature's design, from the structure of the data, to how to best design the UI around it, and how the API endpoint would eventually power it.

Over the course of multiple feedback cycles with both @awesome_developer1 and also customers, we found where inefficiencies were and what sections needed to be cut in favor of more important views.

My own vision for this was to make it look like [early design concept] because I felt that this design would best serve the data and best surface the insights we wanted. Eventually, we ended up going a different direction because customers told us something different.

## Closing
[New Feature] is now out of development and is currently baking in our beta environment for the next week to ensure that no bugs escaped our vision, and any breaking issues are not visible to customers. Any questions, comments, or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me, @awesome_developer1, @awesome_developer2, or @amazing_product_manager.
